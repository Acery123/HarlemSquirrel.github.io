I am a full stack web developer, technologist, educator, musician, and enthusiast of various other worldly curiosities. Since 2016 I have been developing and maintaining commercial, nonprofit, and public software. I view problems as a chance to improve the world around me while gaining some new knowledge and tweaking my skill set.
