I am a full stack web developer, technologist, educator, musician, and enthusiast of various other worldly curiosities. I recently concluded my training at [Flatiron School][flatiron-school] and am excited to meld my years of experience in education and music with my new found prowess in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript to a new opportunity as a developer. I am currently building a small startup that connects apartment renters and expects to go live very soon. I view problems as a chance to improve the world around me while gaining some new knowledge and tweaking my skill set. I would love to be part of a forward-thinking team with ambitious goals in my next gig.
