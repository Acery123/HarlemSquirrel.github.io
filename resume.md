### About Me

![Me at Watkins Glen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarlemSquirrel/kevin_mccormack/master/assets/images/me_watkins_glen.jpg){: .resume-pic }
Since 2016 I have built, deployed, and maintained full stack web applications on Heroku and Jenkins. I document my work in detail using Git and am familiar with both GitHub and Bitbucket. I believe that every application should have a comprehensive test suite. Continous integration with automated testing and deployments are key in maximizing productivity while minimizing downtime.

I am proficient in server side tools including Ruby on Rails and shell scripting. On the client side I am proficient in HTML, CSS (including SCSS), and JavaScript (including jQuery).

Since the fall of 2016, I have been a Software Engineer at [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com) working closely with senior engineers, sales teams, and product teams to deploy an ecosystem of three web apps that advertise on Facebook. I translate product team visions into reality through careful feature planning and execution with engineering teams.
