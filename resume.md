### About Me

![Me at Watkins Glen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarlemSquirrel/kevin_mccormack/master/assets/images/me_watkins_glen.jpg){: .resume-pic }
Since 2016 I have built, deployed, and maintained full stack web applications on Heroku, AWS, Digital Ocean, and on-premise servers. I document my work in detail, use Git for version control, and am familiar with GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. I believe that every application should have a comprehensive test suite. Continuous integration with automated testing and deployments are key in maximizing productivity while minimizing downtime.

I am a big fan of open source software. I have a number of my own projects on GitHub and contribute to other projects when I can such as [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [ActiveLdap](https://github.com/activeldap/activeldap/), and [AmazingPrint](https://github.com/amazing-print/amazing_print/releases).

I am proficient in server side tools including Ruby on Rails and shell scripting. On the client side I am proficient in HTML, CSS (including SCSS), and JavaScript (including jQuery). I am always looking to learn new languages and frameworks. I have been working on Python lately.

Since the spring of 2017, I have been a software engineer at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu) working closely with architects, analysts, the service desk, and non-technical teams to deploy a custom ecosystem of identity management solutions. More recently I have been stepping into the role of solutions architect in building internal and public-facing ecosystems to securely provide the right access and information at the right time to the right eyes.
