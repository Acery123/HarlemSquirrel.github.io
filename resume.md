### About Me

![Me at Watkins Glen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarlemSquirrel/kevin_mccormack/master/assets/images/me_watkins_glen.jpg){: .resume-pic }
Since 2016 I have built, deployed, and maintained full stack web applications on Heroku, AWS and on-premise servers. I document my work in detail using Git and am familiar with GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. I believe that every application should have a comprehensive test suite. Continuous integration with automated testing and deployments are key in maximizing productivity while minimizing downtime.

I am proficient in server side tools including Ruby on Rails and shell scripting. On the client side I am proficient in HTML, CSS (including SCSS), and JavaScript (including jQuery).

Since the spring of 2017, I have been an IAM Engineer at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu) working closely with architects, analysts, the service desk, and non-technical teams to deploy a custom ecosystem of identity management solutions. I build internal and public-facing tools to securely provide the right access and information at the right time to the right eyes.
